# Mildred
Mildred is a mobile app that signs you in and out of your workplace location!


## About
Have you worked anywhere before?<br>
Did you have to sign in to an attendance book record?<br>
Did you have to sign out too?<br>
**Mildred will sign you in and out of your workplace location seamlessly!**
## Why the name "Mildred"?
Mildred happens to be the name of the office manager at a place I worked,<br>
and another Mildred(She never said 'YES' to my proposal =D) <br>
happens to be a friend of mine who was also an office manager <br>
at a different company.<br>
Both of them are in charge of the books that workers use to sign in and out.<br>
So Mildred signs you in and out of the workplace

* Grab location and time when user enters a geofence(signin)
* Grab location and time when user exits a geofence(signout)
* Send user details to a web service
